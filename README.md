Faceshield V10k
-------------------
For now it has a version of a closed faceshield that can be printed in 3 parts and just clamped on (some pliers may help)
I print these in 0.3mm layers PETG, your mileage may vary.
You can fit 6 fronts or 12 temples on one batch on a 260mm delta (like FLSUN QQ-S)

A full faceshield is comprised of 3 parts:

* front *(i3DMT-v10k3-frente-semlogo.stl)*
* left temple *(i3DMT-v10k3-haste-esq.stl)*
* right temple *(i3DMT-v10k3-haste-dir.stl)*

The files *"i3DMT-v10k3-encaixe (1).stl"* and *"i3DMT-v10k3-encaixe (2).stl"* are meant to use as a first test to see if the fit is tight.
It should be tight enough to be *almost impossible* to fully fit by hand.

The files *"i3DMT-v10k3-frente-semlogo-X6.stl"* and *"i3DMT-v10k3-hastes-x6.stl"* are just 6 fronts or 12 temples ready to print (Delta printer optimised)

The holes for the acetate sheet are standard european.
The advantage for me is that I can go to sleep/work while the printer keeps pretty much busy. I'll just have to start a new print every 3/6 hours.
I hope this helps someone increase production as it has helped me.

Credits
-------------------

As much as I want to give proper credits for the original faceshield, the amount of STLs roaming around these days in my local group made that pretty much impossible. I canibalized a version of the shield enhanced by Pedro Neves to split the temples from the front. I'll be happy to give credits to the original faceshield author.
